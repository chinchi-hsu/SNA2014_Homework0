The programs to analyze the difficulty of the homework 0 in the course "Social Network Analysis" (SNA), National Taiwan University, 2014 Fall.

### Homework 0

Students are asked to investigate the basic properties of given social networks. In addition, students have to implement two diffusion models: linear threshold (LT) and independent cascade (IC) running on those social networks.
